Spatial Analysis F* Engine

Installation
============

#. Install dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-gdal python-nose

#. Install this package::

    pip install python-safe

   If you do not have ``pip`` installed but only ``easy_install``,
   you can do::
             sudo easy_install pip

   Also, if you are not under a virtualenv (hint: you should!) you can do::
             sudo pip install python-safe

#. Run the tests::

    nosetests safe

   Please note that nose can only find the tests if you did not use easy_installs, pip uses flat directories instead of eggs. If it says there are 0 tests, it means you probably installed the package without pip.
